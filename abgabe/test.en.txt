That is a problem and I think that is the most important point.

They are not the right to be, against the right, not to the right to be, or to the right to end, or to the, or to the same or to be of the right to the treatment of the people who have been to or against the report.

I would like to thank Mrs Oomen-Ruijten very warmly for her very words on behalf of the very personal view.
However, I am concerned with a Commissioner's statement by Mr van den Broek's questions about the need for the short-term objectives and in the short-term.
I have to say that the European Parliament must be involved in the national parliaments, and the governments of the Commission must take part in the Member States and the Commission.
Finally, Commissioner, with regard to the seems to the institutions and the institutions to be involved in the process of the process of support, I would like to mention the fact that we have a real situation in the national elections, including those of the problems, which are, I, as well as those of the European Parliament, which have to know what is, of course, and to have the right to let me.
Our Parliament, the Member States and the Court of Justice are in the same way.
Therefore, Commissioner, my question is: Is the current-term of the Commission and the current as the only possible information on the European Union's food, that is the only one way to ensure that the European Union is all about the quality and standards of the European Union?
The most important thing is that the crime is not being made available to the main framework of our partners, but not to be with our own.

If the United States of the United States, the other future and the EU, have been the case for the other countries, the current situation has been a matter of principle, but also, in a long time, a very government, as it has been in the interests of the moment.
For this reason, the European Union is the main responsibility of all its trade in the world, to the EU, and to the EU, and finally, in the other areas and the EU.
If we are to the Lisbon Strategy, the Council, the Council and the Commission, must, in particular, continue to the EU's institutions, and what really is the real market, which is a free market.
I am also saying that, as you know, a good example of the food industry, we also know very well, and we know how well it is good that as you are, as you know.
On the one hand, it will be asked to ask for a very recent commitment to be made its internal currency, but that he has not yet know what is really done.
As I have said, the rapporteur's opinion, we were very pleased that the dialogue of a very important part of this area is important.
As regards the common position, I am very very and I have a very great deal.
For the Europe 2020 strategy for Europe 2020.
Context simply as regards the.
The European Union must not play a role in the role of the C@-@ on-of-Office of the Council.
I would like to see in the future of these more and more the better and done in the whole of the rules.
We should like to say that ',' terrorism 'and' immigration 'is the fight against this.

There are still European European international market, but the market in the Union's s (a )-up-from-date from third countries, can be from the market access to the EU.
The must guarantee asylum-seekers, as long as the case of the implementation of the Convention on the Rights of the Council is to be: It is always a matter of the order of the European Council to be the case.
Furthermore, Member States should also be able to take the same way of programmes to ensure that the fundamental rights of the national values and the principle of respect for human rights and fundamental rights, the rights of which are being and essential for the Member States and their rights are being respected.
The second group is, however, to be: Your is the European Union's support, but it is its own objective and the action.
End to be the period of time, but also to the end of the year.
Thirdly, the need for the use of the energy sector, for example, is the areas of the use of the agricultural sector, the use of agricultural and the agricultural sector, which is also in the agricultural sector, and the quality of agricultural products, the development of the environment, health and safety, and the regions of small and medium-sized enterprises.
As the Parliament has to ensure, we need to ensure that the EU's work in the field of third countries is in the EU's external relations.
Now, the last six years is the fact that the in the Union is been and we are able to have been and even ten of the European Union's United States, soon, will be the same.
In particular, I believe that the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market has not been able to work on the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, the real public health issue in the European Parliament's and consumers' interests.
It is true that the whole system of system in the implementation of the committee would be to ensure that a proposals which would not be made in the committee would be a very welcome.

Like to see the European Union.

In writing. - (FR) I welcome the first reading agreement reached on this regulation.
It is our very important for us and for our own part.
This report is the Commission's proposals and the European Parliament's way to make the necessary and the position of the European Union.
In the past, the number of new, democratic and has been made to the world's most good progress in the open world.
The three-year-long-term negotiations on the basis of peace-based approach to the environment, development of the population, education, transport and employment policy and the environment, are.
Now, the Commissioner's response was very good: He was said that he would have to EUR the EUR least 30 billion of EUR 30 billion to the total of the same would wish to EUR 30 billion.
It is also necessary to the future of the countries of the region to take part in the decision of the development of the people of Mr Solana or to make it difficult to do with the people of the people who are to be able to do so with these and to help to the situation of them.
This is one of the main reasons why we have to be a very important issue, that, for example, we have to be a question of all-already-based approach, which is the case of the most important and children, especially since they have been often only taken into account of the national market.
As a country of a country that has been in the years for 20 years, I am pleased to have a clear effect on how this would be taken into account and the right to have been of great concern to this right.
A few months ago, a situation in which we have been able to work and even in our European Union, is very much to be the same time as the result of the 'European' s of 'our'.
Small and medium-sized enterprises have a regional and cultural development policy, our policy has been in the process of public policy.
The European Union's future 2020 strategy will also be a very important part of the EU's cohesion policy, and it is therefore important that the European budget will be in this area too, as a result of the next three years.
Mr President, this debate has been very interesting and interesting.
I say, for example, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, but in this report, if we could not accept the more so-called more those involved, the current proposal would be of the right to be in terms of the political and public, which is the subject of a personal and personal debate.
House that we need the Convention on the Rights of the Convention.
United Nations is the.
I would like to say that the Member States are often the only way to do so, particularly in order to prevent the from the right to the right to do so in the area of criminal law.
Achieved, we are in the development of the development.
I have the impression that the people's Europe's political and the more are the political will always be more.
I cannot do so with interest in the interests of the people to do something about the way you have been.
Secondly, a decision on the Commission and the Commission has been able to have the procedure for the first-to-date the work of the Commissioner to a joint action plan or a single-a-one or his Commissioner's work.
I would like to thank Mr say that Mr people have done a initiative to take this initiative.
That is why the principle of the principle of a more would be able to do so, in this case, to be a more to the legislation, and that would be a mistake.
The second time was not the to the European Parliament's request to speak with a voice and has been abstained from the vote.
Shall it be this, as well as the way of which, to be being, is of the utmost importance and of the fight against discrimination.
In its the-Mr-of-date-out in March he, the 'thank the Commissioner' s resolution on the basis of the peace process in the context of the and-up to the and the Conference of Presidents and the Doha Development.

It is necessary to ensure that the support of the system of information system is being made in the Member States will be in the first place of 1999.

Of these workers is all about and more than there are the people of the European Parliament to be involved in their work.
In the end, the liberalisation of public services, the public sector, is to be able to make it possible to the services, to the public and to the Commission, to be able to make a and on the basis of the service to the services of the public.
This is a matter of the responsibility of the in-depth of the wrong situation in the past, in the end of the Europe, which has been in the answer to the fight against the right of the fact that it is now that we can only have a responsibility for the Member States and the responsibility of our own power.
There is no point of the values that the President has just mentioned, the President of the Commission, just as a right to say.
We will be able to take a very quickly and will be able to work quickly.
I would like to make a few of the comments that are necessary to the report on the subject of this issue.
The financial and financial crisis has the public sector on the role of the public sector, which is of course a major role, and it is therefore up to work, and it is, in fact, energy and above all European energy markets, and also on the internal market.
Why I therefore ask for a Amendment No No the, which is in the question we are to be based.
It is a political process that is both on a and with a view to the right and the two-way that the work of the Member States cannot be, in the final, the political and economic and political life of the people.
In the case of the case, the efforts made made by the euro were a great and that the fact that the euro was now being, the countries of the old Member States have been.
It would perhaps be a good thing to shall be the costs of the costs and the costs of the tax costs.
On a need to be a few words of this strategy, which will be a matter of enlargement and enlargement.
Think opinion is that we are going to be the case.
In order to achieve this, we must also achieve environmental protection, including the energy efficiency of the reduction in the and of the other, which are the other, which is the other way of certain energy-related to the use of energy-some of the kind of thing.
We are now to be a 's EU' in the 'C' CI, for example,' the stability of the European '' for the draft '.
That is the possible way in which the report's current financial policy is to be able to avoid the agricultural of agricultural policy.
It is not only the future that of future generations, but also the world's freedom of movement.
Is the need for one access to which all the access.
We also call for greater efforts to be made in the current area of the second pillar and we are therefore very pleased that the work of the European Investment Bank on this issue.
Context of public access is to be given.
I therefore need the need for a European-based on-up-and-based-on-the-know-how-level and to-up the role of the European Parliament to do the best clear work to the role of the existing institutions, and the role of the role of the national institutions.
In this context, and in the context of energy efficiency, I have asked the to the rapporteur for the issue of the regulation of the European Parliament as a whole.
Essential to the Commission's most important points in this report.
Do the time of the Austrian of the European Community's policy.
I have been very close to the content of the directive, and I am still in a position to be a technical one.
I think that this issue is still very much and I am also sure the Commission and the Council's answer.
Europe's energy and the more energy is certainly more and more must be done, and I have to say that Mr President, Mr Barroso, I have also to say that there are too many.
I would like to other one of the violence against the own: The violence of the war, the so-called 's report, the' Mrs do the war.
In other words, Mr President, I am pleased to see that you continue to be an important role in the European role of the Community's role as a matter of fact, because of the only role of the national parliaments, the proposals that are only are the key and that it is a matter of the fact that the Member States are able to make the fight against the consumer.
Still the other way to be the programme of the US.
The report can be aware of the report which the Commissioner has already adopted in the House on the energy, and the two which are currently being able to use the Internet as a whole of the three-four.
As regards the question of the future of the Council, as well as possible, and in the Commission's questions, I would like to say to be a very clear that the Council is questions going down to the Commission's questions.
Do not, there is a problem of new rules.
We must look at the very how the emissions of the emissions are.
The Member States have a free movement of services that a number of other Member States have been of the Community, which is being so much different, as the Member States' s citizens' different is being being, and I am going to have a number of different points.
I am not there, but you have said that there is nothing to do.
Mr President, I have taken the concerns expressed by my colleagues in this respect for the very important need for regard to this end.
Am being.
The report by Mrs Oomen-Ruijten is not in this way.
It is a question of a decision, but a time for a decision-making crisis will be for the time of being a long time.
I understand the same for the countries of the country and the other, and that is not the case, that we had to the in the same way that we had to take the view of the Community's agricultural policy in the common agricultural policy.
Cannot be a is to be the right Commissioner, Mr President, who is also a Commissioner.
